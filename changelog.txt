Known Issues
------------

    - The lighting in lit rooms sometimes doesn't work correctly, producing a
      banding like effect.  I'm investigating this issue.

    - If the range on your light only partially intersects a lit room (from
      outside), the room doesn't light completely when you enter it.

    - There may be problems with displaying the map or placing the player on a
      level due to incorrect max_panel_rows calculation.

      *Update*  This issue should now be resolved.  If it does occur, the
      code should be able to trap it, correct it and report the condition in
      the error log.  This problem may have existed in the 5.01 original.


Change Log
----------

29 MAR 2015 - 5.02.00.0099
    - Uploading to Git.  As a note, I have attempted to contact Robert Koeneke
      about publishing to GitHub but it seems he is either extraordinarily
      difficult to reach or simply unreachable.  He was involved with an
      Angband group but the address for him there seems to no longer work and
      the group itself seems to have gone dormant.

06 JAN 2014 - 5.02.00.0099
    - This is not a release version.  Bug testing is still underway.  This
      version is reported due to the complexity of the changes made.
    - Created a class (TScrListView) to handle the display of lists/tables.
    - Used the new list class to display the Top 20 list.
    - Used the new list class to display the store lists.
    - Changed the black market store entry marker from 'B' to 'K'.
    - Coming to a town near you, a new "store".  Stay tuned.  This store is
      shown on the town level but cannot be entered as yet.
    - The game will sometimes generate a "tougher" version of a monster on a
      level.  These "elite" monsters are now highlighted.
    - "Innocent" creatures are now displayed with a cyan background instead of
      a green background.
    - Slight changes to the save file format.  Previous versions should
      import with no issues.
    - Rebuilt the inventory system (whew that was a big job).  The inventory
      is now broken into nine (9) "sections" (what the code calls inventory
      types) such as "Weapons", "Armour", "Ammuntion", "General" etc.  The
      item count limit has been removed and you are now able to carry up to
      your weight limit in items, reguardless of how many that is (up to
      MAX_INT or end of memory).  Moved most of the inventory handling code into
      a new file INVENTORY.INC.
    - Used the new list class to display the inventory.
    - Equipping items is no longer a free action.  Swapping between main and
      secondary weapons is now a free action.
    - Fixed a bug in the monster info command which would cause the game to
      "hang" and prevent any monster info from being displayed.
    - The death and win "graphics" are now in colour.  Woo.
    - Fixed not updating maximum carry weight where strength changes.
    - Don't pick up chests.
    - Simplified door bashing messages (pressing space as well as a capital 'B'
      for bashing was hard on the hands).  Its in line with tunnelling now.
    - Removed superfluous DCC string handling IFDEFs and comments (the casts
      seem to go through FPC fine and there is no need to flag them all the
      time).
    - Fixed quite a few range violation bugs.
    - Fixed some strange problems when the terminal window was more than 80
      characters wide or more than 25 characters high.
    - Gold stolen by a creature is now dropped when they are killed (along with
      any other gold or items they are meant to randomly generate).
    - Thanks to Francesco Tortorici the messages are no longer in mixed capitals
      (except for proper names and prefixes which will be fixed soon).
    - The store "remembers" the last inventory tab you were on and returns you
      there in certain situations.
    - There are now shortcut keys for browsing the inventory tabs.
    - You are now given a warning if you are on a terminal detected as having
      problems when in sixteen colour mode.  The message is given once only if
      you "skip" it.
    - Added a user configuration screen where the screen colour mode can be
      changed and tested.

12 NOV 2012 - 5.01.01.0066
    - Instead of Halt, raise an EAbort descendant and trap in main routine
      (this allows clean-up).
    - Space allows you to browse the shop contents, as well as b.
    - Ensure certain item availability in some shops.

11 NOV 2012 - 5.01.01.0063
    - Add errorlog.log file and logging in certain routines.
    - Add DEBUG section and ErrorLog flag to configuration file.
    - Another attempt to resolve the max_panel_rows bug.
    - Now critically hit sleeping creatures (and then they wake up if 
      alive).
    - Now show increased stats in cyan.

09 NOV 2012 - 5.01.01.0054
    - Include Michał's latest vision.inc (to fix light bleeding out of lit
      rooms).

08 NOV 2012 - 5.01.01.0053
    - Fix crash dump save.

07 NOV 2012 - 5.01.01.0052
    - "Ball" effects include a delay while being shown so that they can be
      seen (new terminals update too quickly otherwise).
    - Began killing old code that was kept in comments.
    - Now only use COLR_CREA_NORESP when creature is magically asleep, 
      stunned or confused (instead of also when "idle").
    - In update_mon local routine of the creature routine, creatures are 
      always updated when the attack flag is False and they can be seen.
    - Monsters now have a magically sleeping flag (csleep $8000) such that 
      there is differentiation between an "idle" monster and a sleeping one.
    - A number of updates to status messages (a lot of them and even some
      typo fixes and colour corrections).
    - Pressing an unknown key will no longer waste a turn.
    - Make potions, scrolls and food stuffs identified (no longer say 
      {unknown}) after consumption, when they don't actually do anything.
    - Re-factoring in MISC.INC to move out some routines.
    - Conjured food now has double the "refreshment" value.
    - Fixed bug in Longsword's damage in inventory_init table?
    - Gold should now be far more common in the dungeon.
    - Magical weapons now must have at least +1 to damage (instead of +0 to 
      hit and +0 to damage).

06 NOV 2012 - 5.01.01.0040
    - The characters now start with a much better range of equipment.
    - Items now are marked {magic} for magical items and {unknown} for 
      potions and the like that aren't identified.  This unfortunately 
      seems to mean all items that aren't identified.
    - Further work to resolve display bugs.  max_panel_rows and 
      max_panel_cols are being set with the wrong values.  char_row and
      char_col are also being set incorrectly.
    - Implement a work-around and potential fix for the off-the-screen 
      display bug.
    - Create a new routine to handle crash dump for neatness.
    - Move Intro routine into MAIN.INC.
    - No longer use DateUtils unit (commented out unused routines).

05 NOV 2012 - 5.01.01.0023
    - Show top twenty after introduction.
    - Tidy top twenty at death.
    - Re-included the panel moving modification.
    - Include Michał's updated FOV mod to allow seeing into lit rooms.

02 NOV 2012 - 5.01.01.0019
    - Now attempts to write player crash dump when an exception is raised.
    - Source better organised into src folder.

01 NOV 2012 - 5.01.01.0014
    - Version screen now shows revision and build numbers as well as date.
    - Now include revision and build numbers and build date.
    - Character creation now shows all bonuses from race and class while 
      rolling the stats and is done as a separate step.
    - Character creation now allows going back to the previous step from
      each step in the creation.

30 OCT 2012 - 5.01.01.0001
    - Backed out the panel moving modification for now.
    - Added config setting for large cursor.
    - Added config setting for screen mode.
    - Added configuration file config.ini. 
    - Re-factored the "main block" in Moria.dpr; added MAIN.INC.
    - Added screen mode for B&W, 8 colour or 16 colour for compatibility.
    - Added screen update control in several key routines.
    - Standardised colours by using a modified CRT unit for 
      Unix/Linux/Mac OSX (allow the use of AIX extensions).  Thank you to
      Michał for showing me the ANSI escape codes.
    - Changed the speed of the Duck creature so its not so deadly (the
      humour has suffered a little but it was over the top and it appears 
      very often).
    - Standard rations make you full and elvish waybread very full.  This
      will be worked on for the next release (for difficulty settings).
    - Fixed a mana display bug causing the Ranger class to fail creation.

    - There was a release here but it was retracted due to the next bug
      (Ranger creation fail).
    - Implement a screen wrapping class and crt descendant class.

    - Added Michał Bieliński's FOV and panel move modification.
    - Moved initialised constant data from VARIABLES to new file
      TABLES.INC.
    - Redisplay creatures and player after updates.
    - Added colour.
    - Fixed racial search skill bonus not being copied to player.
    - Removed time of day limitations.
    - Removed user preventions.
    - Removed save file encryption for now since the routines are 
      bugged on modern platforms.  This may be reintroduced over the next 
      few versions.
    - Ported to Delphi and Free Pascal.

<H1>Moria Manual</H1>
<H2>1. Adventuring</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Once your character is adequately
supplied with food, light, armour, and weapons, he is ready to enter
the dungeon. Move on top of the '&gt;' symbol and use the down '&gt;'
command. Your character enters a maze of interconnecting staircases
and finally passes through a one-way door. He is now on the first
level of the dungeon (50 feet), and must survive many horrible and
challenging encounters to find the treasure lying about.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<H3>1.1. Armour Class</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Armour class is a number that
describes the amount and the quality of armour begin worn. Armour
class will generally run from about 0 to 40, but could become
negative or greater than 40 in rare cases.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The larger your armour class, the
more protective it is. A negative armour class would actually help
get you hit. Armour protects you in three manners. One, it makes you
harder to be hit for damage. A hit for no damage is the same as a
miss. Two, good armour will absorb some of the damage that your
character would have taken. An armour class of 30 would absorb 30% of
any damage meant for him. Three, fire and acid damage are reduced by
wearing body armour. It is obvious that a high armour class is a must
for surviving the lower levels of MORIA.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Each piece of armour has an armour
class adjustment, and a magical bonus. Armour bought in town will
have these values displayed with their description. Armour that is
found within the dungeon must be identified before these values will
be displayed. Armour class values are always displayed between a set
of brackets '[#,+#]'. The first value is the armour class of the
item. The second number is the magical bonus of the item, and will
always have a sign preceding the value. There are a few cases where
the form '[+#]' is used, meaning the object has no armour class, only
a magical armour bonus if worn.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Some pieces of armour will possess
special abilities denoted by the following abbreviations:</P>

<H3>1.2. Bashing</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Weight is the primary factor in being
able to bash something, but strength plays a role too. After bashing,
a character may be off balance for several rounds depending upon his
DEXTERITY.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Doors can be broken down by bashing
them. Once a door is bashed open, it is forever useless and cannot be
closed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Chests too may be bashed open, but be
warned that the careless smashing of a chest often ruins the
contents. Bashing open a chest will not disarm any traps it may
contain, but does allow the strong and ignorant to see what's inside.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Finally, a creature may be bashed. If
a shield is currently being worn, the bash is a shield bash and will
do more damage. In either case, a bash may throw an opponent off
balance for a number of rounds, allowing a player to get in a free
hit or more. If the player is thrown off-balance, his opponent may
get free hits on him. This is a risky attack.</P>
<H3>1.3. Cursed Objects</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Some objects, mainly armour and
weapons, have had curses laid upon them. These horrible objects will
look like any other normal item, but will detract from your
characters stats or abilities if worn. They will also be impossible
to remove until a remove curse is done.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">When a cursed item has been
identified, an asterisk '*' will appear next to the inventory letter
of the item. If you should wear a cursed item, you will immediately
know it is cursed and again the asterisk will appear.</P>
<H3>1.4. Death</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">If your character falls below 0 hit
points, he has died and cannot be restored. A tombstone showing
information about your character will be displayed with the option to
print the information to a file.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">After the tombstone, the top-twenty
list of heroes is displayed. If your score beats any of the
top-twenty, your character will join this elite rank of heroes.
Otherwise, well, there is always next time...</P>
<H3>1.5. Fighting</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Attacking is simple in MORIA. If you
move into a creature, you attack him. You can attack from a distance
by firing a missile, or by magical means such as aiming a wand.
Creatures attack in the same way, if they move into you, they attack
you. Some creatures can cast spells from a distance, and dragon type
creatures can breath from a distance, but these are the only
exceptions.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">If you are wielding a weapon, the
damage for the weapon is used when you hit the creature. If you are
wielding no weapons, you get two fist strikes. Note that very strong
creatures can do a lot of damage with their fists... A character may
have a primary and secondary weapon. A secondary weapon is kept on
the</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">belt, or on the shoulder for
immediate use. You can switch between your primary and secondary
weapons by using the 'x' command. Be sure you are wielding the proper
weapon when fighting. Hitting a dragon over the head with a bow will
simply make him mad, and get you killed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Missile weapons, such as bows, can be
wielded, and then the proper missile, in this case an arrow, can be
fired across the room into a target. Missiles can be used without the
proper missile weapon, but used together they have a greater range
and do far more damage.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Hits and misses are determined by
ability to hit VS armour class. A miss doesn't necessarily mean you
failed to hit the target, but only that you failed to do any damage.
Therefore a 'hit' is a strike that does some damage. Higher armour
classes make it harder to do damage, therefore more misses.</P>
<H3>1.6. Light</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">There are two sources for light once
inside the dungeon. Permanent light which has been magically placed
within rooms, and a light source carried by the player. If neither is
present, the character will be unable to map or see any attackers.
Lack of light will also affect searching, picking locks, and
disarming.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">A character must wield a torch or
lamp in order to supply his own light. Once a torch or lamp has only
50 or less turns left before burning out, the message &quot;Your
light is getting low&quot; will be displayed at random intervals.
Once a torch is burnt out, it is useless and can be dropped. A lamp
or lantern can be</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">refilled with oil by using the Fill
'F' command. You must of course be carrying extra oil to refill a
lantern.</P>
<H3>1.7. Mining</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Much of the treasure within the
dungeon can be found only by mining it out of the walls. Many rich
strikes exist within each level, but must be found and mined. Quartz
veins are the richest, yielding the most metals and gems, but magma
veins will have some hordes hidden within.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Mining is virtually impossible
without a pick or shovel. Picks and shovels have an additional
magical ability expressed as '(+#)'. The higher the number, the
better the magical digging ability of the tool. Note that a pick or
shovel also has pluses to hit and damage, and can be used as a
weapon.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">When a vein of quartz or magma is
located, the character should wield his pick or shovel and begin
digging out a section. When that section is removed, he should locate
another section of the vein, and begin the process again. Since
granite rock is much harder to dig through, it is much faster to
follow the vein exactly and dig around the granite.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">If the character has a scroll or
staff of treasure location, he can immediately locate all strikes of
treasure within a vein shown on the screen. This makes mining much
easier and more profitable.</P>
<H3>1.8. Objects</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The mines are full of objects just
waiting to be picked up and used. How did they get there? Well, the
main source for useful items are all the foolish adventurers that
proceeded into the dungeon before you. They get killed, and the
helpful monsters scatter the various treasure throughout the dungeon.
Most cursed items are placed there by the joyful evil sorcerers, who
enjoy a good joke when it gets you killed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">You pick up objects by moving on top
of them. You can carry up to 22 different items in your backpack
while wearing and wielding many others. Note that although you are
limited to 22 different items, you may be carrying several of each
item restricted only by the amount of weight your character can
carry.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Your character's weight limit is
determined by his Strength. Only one object may occupy any one given
floor location, which may or may not also contain one monster. Note
that doors, traps, and staircases are considered objects for this
purpose.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Many objects found within the dungeon
have special commands for their use. Wands must be Aimed, staves must
be Used, scrolls must be Read, and potions must be Quaffed. In any
case, you must first be able to carry an object before you can use
it. Some objects, such as chests, are very complex. Chests contain
other objects and may be trapped, and/or locked. Read the list of
player commands carefully for a further understanding of chests.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">One item in particular will be
discussed here. The scroll of &quot;Word of Recall&quot; can be found
within the dungeon, or bought at the temple in town. It acts in two
manners, depending upon your current location. If read within the
dungeon, it will teleport you back to town. If read in town, it will
teleport you back down to the deepest level of the dungeon one which
your character has previously been. This makes the scroll very useful
for getting back to the deeper levels of MORIA. Once the scroll has
been read it takes a while for the spell to act, so don't expect it
to save you in a crisis.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">And lastly, a final warning. Not all
objects are what they seem. Skeletons lying peacefully about the
dungeon have been known to get up...</P>
<H3>1.9. Secret Doors</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Many secret doors are used within the
dungeon to confuse and demoralise adventurers foolish enough to
enter. But with some luck, and lots of concentration, you can find
these secret doors.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Secret doors will sometimes hide
rooms or corridors, or even entire sections of that level of the
dungeon. Sometimes they simply hide small empty closets or even dead
ends.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Creatures in the dungeon will
generally know and use this secret doors. If they leave one open, you
will be able to go right through it. If they close it behind them you
will have to search for the catch first. Once a secret door has been
discovered by you, it is drawn as a known door and no more searching
will be required to use it.</P>
<H3>1.10. Staircases</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Staircases are the manner in which
you get deeper, or climb out of the dungeon. The symbols for the up
and down staircases are the same as the commands to use them. A '&lt;'
represents an up staircase and a '&gt;' represents a down staircase.
You must move your character over the staircase before you can use
them.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Each level has at least one up
staircase, and at least two down staircases. There are no exceptions
to this rule. You may have trouble finding some well hidden secret
doors, but the stairs are there.</P>
<H3>1.11. Weapons</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Carrying a weapon in your backpack
does you no good. You must wield a weapon before it can be used in a
fight. Note that a secondary weapon can be kept by wielding it and
then using the exchange command 'x'. A secondary weapon is not in
use, simply ready to be switched with the current weapon if needed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Weapons have two main
characteristics; their ability to hit and their ability to do damage,
expressed as '(+#,+#)'. A normal weapon would be '(+0,+0)'. Many
weapons in MORIA have magical MORIA bonuses to hit and/or do damage.
Some weapons are cursed, and have penalties that hurt the player.
Note that cursed swords cannot be un-wielded until the curse is
lifted.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Missile weapons, such as bows, have
only one major characteristic which is to hit, expressed '(+#)'. This
plus to hit is added to that of the missile used, if the proper
weapon/missiles combination are used.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Although you receive any magical
bonuses an unidentified weapon may possess when you wield it, those
bonuses will not be added in to the displayed values of to-hit and
to-dam on your character sheet. You must identify the weapon before
the displayed values reflect the real values used.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Finally, some rare weapons have
special abilities. This are called ego weapons, and are feared by
great and meek. An ego sword must be wielded to receive benefit of
it's abilities.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Special weapons are denoted by the
following abbreviations:</P>

<H3>1.12. Winning</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Once your character has progressed
into killing dragons with but a mean glance and snap of his fingers,
he may be ready to take on the Balrog. The Balrog will appear on
every level after level 49, so don't go down there until you are
ready for him.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The Balrog cannot be killed in some
of the easier methods used on normal creatures. Because of the
Balrog's cunning, he will teleport away to another level if a spell
such as genocide is used upon him, and the Balrog cannot be
polymorphed, slept, or charmed. Magical spells like coldball are
effective against him as are weapons, but he is difficult to kill and
if allowed to escape for a time can heal himself.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">If you should actually survive the
attempt of killing the Balrog, you will receive the status of WINNER.
Since yo have defeated the toughest monster alive, your character is
ready to retire and cannot be saved. When you quit the game, your
character receives a surprise bonus score and is entered into the
top-twenty file.</P>

<H3>1.13. Wizards</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There are rumors of MORIA Wizards
which, if asked nicely, can explain details of the MORIA game that
seem complicated to beginners. In addition, they have special spells
which can restore characters lost by accident, such as power-outs and
such.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<H2>2. Character</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">All characters have six main
attributes which modify their basic abilities. These six attributes,
called stats, are STRENGTH, INTELLIGENCE, WISDOM, DEXTERITY,
CONSTITUTION, and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">CHARISMA. Stats may vary from 3 as a
minimum to 18/100 as a maximum. Because adventurers of interest tend
to be better than average characters, MORIA stats will average about
12.5, and are further adjusted by race and class. Some races are just
naturally better at being certain classes, as will be shown</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">later.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">In addition to the more visible
stats, each character has certain abilities which are mainly
determined by his race and class, but are also modified by his stats.
The abilities are FIGHTING, THROWING/BOWS, SAVING THROW, STEALTH,
DISARMING, MAGICAL DEVICES, PERCEPTION, SEARCHING, and INFRA-VISION.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Characters will be assigned an early
history, with money and a social class based on that history.
Starting money is assigned based on history, charisma, and somewhat
upon the average of a character's stats. A character with below
average stats will receive extra money to help him survive the first
adventure.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Each character will also have
physical attributes such as a race, a height, weight, sex, and a
physical description. None of these, except weight, play any part in
the game other than to give the player a &quot;feeling&quot; for his
character. Weight is used for computing carrying capacity and also
for BASHING.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Finally each character is assigned
HIT POINTS based on their race, class, and constitution. Spell
casters will also receive &quot;MANA&quot; which is expended when
casting spells. MANA is based on Wisdom for Priests and Intelligence
for Mages.</P>
<a id="#Character_Abilities"><H3>2.1. Abilities</H3></a>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Characters possess nine different
abilities which can help them to survive. The starting abilities of
characters are based upon the race and class of characters. Abilities
may be adjusted by high or low stats, or may increase with the level
of the character.</P>
<H4>2.1.1. Fighting</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Fighting is the ability to hit and do
damage with weapons or fists. Normally a character gets a single blow
from any weapon, but if his dexterity and strength are high enough,
he may receive more blows per round with lighter weapons. Strength
and dexterity both modify the ability to hit an opponent. In addition
this skill increases with the level of the character.</P>
<H4>2.1.2. Throwing/Bows</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Using stand-off missile weapons and
throwing objects is included in the skill. Different stats apply to
different weapons, but may modify the distance an object is
thrown/fired, the amount of damage done, and the ability to hit a
creature. This skill increases with the level of the character.</P>
<H4>2.1.3. Saving Throw</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A Saving Throw is the ability of a
character to resist the effects of a spell cast on him by another
person/creature. Note that this does not include spells cast on the
player by his own stupidity, such as quaffing a nasty potion. This
ability increases with the level of the character, but then most high
level creatures are better at casting spells, so it tends to even
out.</P>
<H4>2.1.4. Stealth</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The ability to move silently about is
very useful. Characters with good stealth can usually surprise their
opponents, gaining the first blow. Also, creatures may fail to notice
a stealthy character entirely, allowing a player to avoid certain
fights.</P>
<H4>2.1.5. Disarming</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Disarming is the ability to remove
traps (safely), and includes picking locks on traps and doors. Note
that a successful disarming will gain the character some experience.
The character must have found a trap before it can be disarmed.
Dexterity and intelligence both modify the ability to disarm, and
this ability increases with the level of the character.</P>
<H4>2.1.6. Using Magical Devices</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Using a magical device such as a wand
or staff requires experience and knowledge. Spell users such as mages
and priests are therefore much better at using a magical device than
say a fighter. This skill is modified by intelligence, and increases
with the level of the character.</P>
<H4>2.1.7. Perception</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Perception is the ability to notice
something without actively seeking it out. This skill is based
entirely upon race and class, and will never improve unless magically
enhanced.</P>
<H4>2.1.8. Searching</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">To search is to actively look for
secret doors, floor traps, and traps on chests. Rogues are the best
at searching, but mages, rangers, and priests are good at it.
Intelligence modifies your ability of searching, and your ability
will also increase with your level.</P>
<H4>2.1.9. Infra-Vision</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Infra-vision is the ability to see heat
sources. Since most of the dungeon is cool or cold, infra-vision will
not allow the player to see walls and objects. Infra-vision will
allow a character to see any warm-blooded creatures up to a certain
distance. This ability works equally well with or with out a light
source. Note that the majority of Moria's creatures are cold blooded,
and will not be detected unless lit up by a light</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">source.</P>
<H3>2.2. Classes</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Once a race has been chosen, you will
need to pick a class. Some classes will not be available to certain
races; for instance a Half-Troll cannot become a Paladin. For the
first few adventures it is suggested that you run a warrior or rogue.
Spell casting classes tend to take much more experience with the game
to keep them alive.</P>
<H4>2.2.1. Warrior</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A Warrior is a hack-and-slash
character, who solves most of his problems by cutting them to pieces,
but will occasionally fall back on the help of a magical device. His
prime stats are Strength and Constitution, and a good Dexterity can
really help at times. A Warrior will be good at Fighting and
Throwing/Bows,</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">but bad at most other skills.</P>
<H4>2.2.2. Mage</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A Mage must live by his wits. He cannot
hope to simply hack his way through the dungeon, and so must
therefore use his magic to defeat, deceive, confuse, and to escape
with. A mage is not really complete without a golf-cart of magical
devices to use in addition to his spells. He can master the higher
level magical devices far easier than anyone else, and has the best
saving throw to resist effects of spells cast at him. Intelligence
and Dexterity are his primary stats. There is no rule that says a
mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells are his true realm.</P>
<H4>2.2.3. Priest</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A Priest is a character of holy
devotion. They explore the dungeon only to destroy the evil that
lurks within, and if treasure just happens to fall into their packs;
well, so much more to the glory of their church! Priests receive
their spells from a diety, and therefore do not choose which spells
they will learn. He is familiar with magical devices, preferring to
call them instruments of god, but is not as good as a mage in their
use. Priests have good saving throws, and make decent fighters,
preferring blunt weapons over edged ones. Wisdom and Charisma are the
priests primary stats.</P>
<H4>2.2.4. Rogue</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A Rogue is a character that prefers to
live by his cunning, but is capable of fighting his way out of a
tight spot. He is the master of traps and locks, no device being
impossible for him to over-come. A rogue has a high stealth allowing
him to sneak around many creatures without having to fight, or sneak
up and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">get the first blow. A rogue's
perception is higher than any other class, and many times he will
notice a trap or secret door before having to search. A rogue is
better than warriors or paladins with magical devices, but still can
not rely on their performance. A rogue's primary stats are
Intelligence and Dexterity.</P>
<H4>2.2.5. Ranger</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A Ranger is a fighter/mage. He is a
good fighter, and the best of the classes with a missile weapon such
as a bow. The ranger learns spells much more slowly than a mage, but
is capable of learning all but the most powerful spell. Because a
ranger is really a dual class character, it requires more experience
to advance him. A ranger has a good stealth, good perception, good
searching, a good saving throw, and is good with magical devices. His
primary stats are Intelligence and Dexterity.</P>
<H4>2.2.6. Paladin</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A Paladin is a fighter/priest. He is a
very good fighter, second only to the warrior class, but not very
good at missile weapons. He receives prayers at a slower pace then
the priest, and can receive all but the most powerful prayer. Because
a paladin is really a dual class character, it requires more
experience to advance him. A paladin lacks much in the way of
abilities. He is poor at stealth, perception, searching, and magical
devices. He has a decent saving throw due to his divine alliance. His
primary stats are Strength and Charisma.</P>
<H3>2.3. Races</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There are eight different races that
you can choose from in MORIA. Some races are restricted as to what
profession they may be, and each race has it's own adjustments to a
character's abilities.</P>
<H4>2.3.1. Human</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The human is the base character, all
other races are compared to him. Human's can choose any class, and
are average at everything. Humans tend to go up levels faster than
any other race, because of their shorter life-spans. No racial
adjustments occur to character's choosing human.</P>
<H4>2.3.2. Half-Elf</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Half-elves tend to be smarter and
faster than a human, but not as strong. Half-elves are slightly
better at searching, disarming, perception, stealth, and magic, but
they are not as good at hand weapons. Half-elves may choose any
class.</P>
<H4>2.3.3. Elf</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Elves are better magicians then humans,
but not as good at fighting. They tend to be smarter and faster than
either humans or half-elves, and also have better wisdom. Elves are
better at searching, disarming, perception, stealth, and magic, but
they are not as good at hand weapons. Elves may choose any class
except Paladin.</P>
<H4>2.3.4. Halfling</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Halflings, or Hobbits, are very good at
bows, throwing, and have good saving throws. They also are very good
at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth; so they make
excellent thieves (but prefer to be called burglars...). They will be
much weaker than humans, and no good at bashing. Halflings have fair</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">infra-vision, so can detect warm
creatures at a distance. Halflings can choose between being a
fighter, mage, or rogue.</P>
<H4>2.3.5. Gnome</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Gnomes are smaller than dwarfs, but
larger than halflings. They, like the halflings, live in the earth in
burrow-like homes. Gnomes are practical jokers, so if they can kill
something in a humorous way, so much the better. Gnomes make
excellent mages, and have very good saving throws. They are good at
searching, disarming, perception, and stealth. They have lower
strengths and constitutions then humans, so therefore do not make as
good of fighters. Gnomes have fair infra-vision, so can detect warm
creatures at a distance. A gnome may choose between being a fighter,
mage, priest, or rogue.</P>
<H4>2.3.6. Dwarf</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Dwarves are the headstrong miners and
fighters of legend. Since dungeons are the natural home of a dwarf,
they are excellent choices for a warrior or priest. Dwarves tend to
be stronger, have higher constitutions, but are slower and less
intelligent than humans. Because they are so headstrong and are</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">somewhat wise, they resist spells which
are cast on them. Dwarves also have good infra-vision because they
live underground. They do have one big draw-back though. Dwarves are
loud-mouthed and proud, singing in loud voices, arguing with
themselves for no good reason, screaming out challenges at imagined
foes. In other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth.</P>
<H4>2.3.7. Half-Orc</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Half-Orcs make excellent fighters, and
decent priests, but are terrible at magic. They are as bad as dwarves
at stealth, and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception.
Half-Orcs are; let's face it, ugly. They tend to pay more for goods
in town. Half-Orcs do make good priest's and rogues, for the simple
reason that Half-Orcs tend to have great constitutions and lots of
hit points.</P>
<H4>2.3.8. Half-Troll</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and
have the highest hit points of any character race. They are also very
stupid and slow. They will make great fighters and iffy priests. They
are bad at searching, disarming, perception, and stealth. They are so
ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in their presence. They also happen to
be fun to run...</P>
<H3>2.4. Sex</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">You may choose to be either a male or a
female character. Only height and weight are affected by a
character's sex. Female characters tend to be somewhat smaller and
lighter then their male counterparts. No adjustments to stats or
abilities are made because of the sex of a character.</P>
<H3>2.5. Stats</H3>
<H4>2.5.1. STR - Strength</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Strength is important in fighting with
weapons, or hand to hand. A high strength can improve your chances of
hitting, and the amount of damage done with each hit. Characters with
low strengths may receive penalties. Strength is also useful in
tunneling, body and shield bashing, etc.</P>
<H4>2.5.2. INT - Intelligence</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Intelligence is the prime stat of a
mage, or magician. A high intelligence increases a mages chances of
learning spells, and in gaining mana. No spell may be learned by
mages with intelligences under 8. Intelligence also modifies a
character's chance of disarming traps and picking locks.</P>
<H4>2.5.3. WIS - Wisdom</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Wisdom is the prime stat of a priest. A
high wisdom increases the chance of recieving new spells from a
priest's diety, and in the gaining of mana. Wisdom also modifies a
character's chance of resisting magical spells cast upon his person.</P>
<H4>2.5.4. DEX - Dexterity</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Dexterity is the combination of agility
and quickness. A high dexterity may allow a character to get multiple
blows with lighter weapons, thus greatly increasing his kill power,
and may increase his chances of hitting with any weapon. Dexterity is
also useful in picking locks and disarming traps.</P>
<H4>2.5.5. CON - Constitution</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Constitution is a characters ability to
resist damage to their body, and to recover from damage received.
Therefore a character with a high constitution will receive more hit
points, and be more resistant to poisons.</P>
<H4>2.5.6. CHR - Charisma</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Charisma represents a character's
personality, as well as physical looks. A character with a high
charisma will receive better prices from store owners, whereas a
character with a very low charisma will be robbed blind. A high
charisma will also mean more money when the character starts out.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<H2>3. COMMANDS</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">All commands are entered by pressing a
single key, or control sequence (holding down the control key while
pressing a key). If a particular command requires additional action,
it will be prompted for, with one exception. When a direction is
required, no prompt is given unless and until an illegal response is
given.</P>
<H3>3.1. Directions</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">In the following instructions, the
symbol &lt;Dir&gt; refers to a numeric direction based on your
keypad. It is not valid to use the number '5' in this context. One
exception to this is with movement, in which case '5' will rest the
character for one turn.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Commands which require a direction
will not prompt you for one, unless you input an illegal direction.
Just enter a direction after the entering the command.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

</P>
<H3>3.2. Movement</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Movement is accomplished by using
your numeric keypad. Simply press a number and your character will
move one step in that direction. Pressing a '5' is equivalent to
waiting for one round (More efficient resting over long periods of
time is accomplished by using the Rest command). You can only move
onto and through floor spots, and only if they contain no creatures
or obstructing objects such as a closed door.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Moving your character one step at a
time can be time consuming and boring, so a faster method has been
supplied. By using the Move command '.', you may move in a direction
until something interesting happens. For instance, by pressing the
period key '.' followed by the direction 8, your character would
continue to move up the screen, only coming to a stop after at least
one condition is satisfied. These conditions are:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A creature appears upon the
	screen, or a creature already on the screen moves.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">You move next to an object, or
	feature such as a door, staircase, or trap.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">You come to a wall, and have more
	than one choice of directions from which to continue, or are in a
	dead- end passage.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">You come to a junction of several
	passages.</P>

</P>
<H3>3.3. Bash</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">B &lt;Dir&gt; - Bash</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The Bash command includes breaking
open doors and chests, or bashing an opponent. Two main factors
determine the ability of a character to bash; their weight and their
strength. In addition, when bashing an opponent, you will either
perform a body bash, or if wielding a shield, perform a shield bash
which is more effective.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Bashing a door can throw the
character off-balance, but this will not generally be a problem.
Doors that have been jammed closed with spikes can only be opened by
bashing. Locked doors may also be bashed open. Note that bashing a
door open will permanently break it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Bashing a creature has effects on
both the player and his opponent. Depending on a character's
dexterity, he may or may not be thrown off-balance allowing free
moves to his opponents. If the bash is successful, the opponent will
be thrown off-balance for 1 to 3 turns, thus allowing the character
free hits or a chance to run.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">A player automatically performs a
shield bash instead of a body bash, if he is currently wearing a
shield. A shield bash adds the damage of a shield to that of the
bash, so is more effective. Note that size and material both affect
the damage that a shield will do.</P>
<H3>3.4. Character</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">C - Print character (to screen or
file)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">This command allows the player to
either display his character on the terminal screen, or to print an
entire character info listing to a file. If printed to a file,
history, equipment list, and an inventory list are included.</P>
<H3>3.5. Disarm</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">D &lt;Dir&gt; - Disarm a trap.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">You can attempt to disarm floor
traps, or trapped chests. If you fail to disarm a trap, there is a
chance that you blunder and set it off. You can only disarm a trap on
a chest after finding it with the search command.</P>
<H3 STYLE="margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0.2cm">3.6. Eat</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">E - Eat some food.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">A character must eat occasionally to
remain effective. As a character grows hungry, a message will appear
at the bottom of the screen saying &quot;Hungry&quot;. If a character
remains hungry long enough, he will become weak and eventually start
fainting.</P>
<H3>3.7. Fill</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">F - Fill a lamp or lantern with oil.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">If your character is currently using
a lamp for light, and if he has a flask of oil in inventory, he may
refill the lamp by using this command. A lamp is capable of a maximum
of 5500 turns of light, and each flask has 5000 turns of oil
contained in it.</P>
<H3>3.8. Location</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">L - Display map co-ordinates.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The Location command will display
your character's current co-ordinates as shown on a printed map
(printed with the 'P' command). Sectors contain up to 44 rows by 99
columns each. The Location command will display the character's
current row and column map co-ordinates, as well as the sector
number.</P>
<H3>3.9. Print</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">P - Print map to file.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The Print command will write an
entire map of the dungeon floor explored to a file. Since the dungeon
floor is large, the map is broken up into sectors, each containing up
to 44 rows by 99 columns.</P>
<H3>3.10. Rest</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">R - Rest for a number of turns.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">You may rest one turn by pressing the
'5' key. Resting for longer periods of time is accomplished by using
the Rest command, followed by the number of turns you want to rest
your character. Resting will continue until the specified duration
has expired, or something to wake the character happens, such as a
creature wandering by. It is sometimes a good idea to rest a beat-up
character until he regains some of his hit points, but be sure to
have plenty of food if you rest often.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">If you have accidentally entered in a
rest period too large, or change your mind about the resting period,
you may wake your character up by pressing any key.</P>
<H3>3.11. Search Mode</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">S - Search mode toggle.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The Searching toggle will take the
character into and out of searching mode. When first pressed, the
message &quot;Searching&quot; will appear at the bottom of the
screen. The character is now taking two turns for each command, one
for the command and one turn to search about him. Note that this
means he is taking twice the time to move about the dungeon, and
therefore twice the food. If a creature should happen by or attack
you, search mode will automatically shut off. Otherwise you may turn
off search mode by again pressing the 'S' key.</P>
<H3>3.12. Tunnel</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">T &lt;Dir&gt; - Tunnel through rock.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Tunnelling (Mining) is a very useful
art. There are four kinds of rock present in the dungeons of Moria;
Permanent Rock, Granite Rock, Magma Intrusion, and Quartz Veins.
Permanent Rock is exactly that, permanent. Granite is very hard,
therefore hard to dig through, and contains no valuable metals. Magma
and Quartz veins are softer and sometimes bare valuable metals and
gems, shown as a '$' or a '*' character. You can tell if the metal or
gems are embedded into the wall by trying to move onto them. If you
can't move over them, you'll have to dig them out.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Tunnelling can be VERY difficult by
hand, so when you dig be sure to wield either a shovel or a pick.
Magical shovels and picks can be found which allow the wielder to dig
much faster than normal, and a good strength also helps.</P>
<H3>3.13. Aim</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">a &lt;Dir&gt; - Aim a wand.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Wands must be aimed in a direction to
be used. Wands are a magical device and therefore use the Magical
Devices ability of the player. They will either affect the first
object/creature encountered, or affect anything in a given direction,
depending upon the wand. An obstruction such as door or wall will
general stop the effects of a wand from travelling further.</P>
<H3>3.14. Browse</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">B - Browse a book.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">You can only read a book if you are of
it's realm. Therefore a magic user could read a magic book, but not a
holy book. Fighter's will not be able to read either kind of book.
When the browse command is used, all of the spells or prayers
contained in the book along with information about it, such as it's
level, the amount of mana used up in casting it, and whether or not
you know the spell or prayer will be displayed. There are a total of
31 different magical spells in four books, and 31 different prayers
in three books.</P>
<H3>3.15. Close</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">c &lt;Dir&gt; - Close a door.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Non-intelligent and certain other
creatures will not be able to open a door. Therefore shutting doors
can be a life saver. You must be adjacent to an open door, and you
cannot close broken doors. Note that bashing a door open will break
it.</P>
<H3>3.16. Drop</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">d - Drop an object from you
inventory.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">You can drop a single object onto the
floor beneath you if that floor spot does not already contain an
object. Note that doors and traps are considered objects in this
sense. If you drop an object such as a potion or scroll, a single one
is dropped onto the floor at a time. Group objects such as arrows are
all dropped at once onto the floor.</P>
<H3>3.17. Equipment</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">e - Display a list of equipment being
used.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Use the Equipment command to display
a list of objects currently being used by your character. Note that
each object has a specific place were it is placed, and that only one
object of each type may be used at any one time; excepting rings of
which two can be worn, one on each hand.</P>
<H3>3.18. Fire</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">f &lt;Dir&gt; - Throw an object/Use a
bow.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">You may throw any object carried by
your character. Depending upon the weight of an object, it may travel
across a room or drop down beside you. If you throw an object such as
an arrow, only one will be used at a time.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">If you throw at a creature, your
chance of hitting the creature is determined by your pluses to hit,
your ability at throwing, and the objects pluses to hit. Once the
creature is hit, the object may or may not do any actual damage to
it. Certain objects in the dungeon can do great amounts of damage
when thrown, but it's for you to figure out the obscure ones. Oil
flasks are considered to be lit before thrown, therefore they will do
fire damage to a creature if they hit it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">To use a bow with arrows, simply
wield the bow and throw the arrows. Extra pluses to damage and
hitting are gained by wielding the proper weapon and throwing the
corresponding ammo. A heavy crossbow with bolts for example, is a
killer...</P>
<H3>3.19. Help</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">h - Enter the MORIA help library.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">A subprocess is spawned and the HELP
utility entered. Help on individual commands may be displayed without
actually exiting your game. You may return to your game by entering a
&lt;CONTORL&gt;-Z character.</P>
<H3>3.20. Inventory</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">I - Display a list of objects being
carried.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The Inventory command displays a list
of all objects being carried, but are not in current use. You may
carry up to 22 different kinds of objects, not including those in
your equipment list. Depending upon your strength, you will be able
carry many identical objects before hitting your weight limit.</P>
<H3>3.21. Jam</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">j &lt;Dir&gt; - Jam a door with an
iron spike.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Most humanoid and many intelligent
creatures can simply open a closed door, and can eventually get
through a locked door. Therefore you may spike a door in order to jam
it. Each spike used on a door will increase it's strength. It is very
easy to jam a door so much as to make it impossible for your
character to</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">bash it down, so spike doors wisely.
Note that the bigger a creature is, the easier it can bash a door
down. Therefore four or more spikes might be necessary to slow down a
dragon, where one spike would slow down a kobold.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<H3>3.22. Magic</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">m - Cast a magic spell.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">First, a character must have learned
a spell before he can cast it. Next, when casting a spell, he must
read the spell from a book, so a book containing the spell must be in
his inventory. Each spell has a chance of failure which starts out
fairly large but decreases as a character gains levels. If a
character does not have the available mana, he increases his chance
of failure, and gambles on losing a point of constitution. Note that
since a character must read the spell from a book, he cannot be blind
or confused when casting a spell, and there must be some light
present.</P>
<H3>3.23. Look</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">l &lt;Dir&gt; - Look in a direction.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The Look command is useful in
identifying the exact type of object or creature shown on the screen.
Also, if a creature is on top of an object, the look command will
describe both. You can see creatures and objects up to 200 feet away
(20 units). Note that you may freely use the Look command without the
creatures getting a move on you.</P>
<H3>3.24. Open</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">o &lt;Dir&gt; - Open a door, chest, or
lock.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">To open an object such as a door or
chest you must use the Open command. If the object is locked, the
Open command will attempt to pick the lock, based on your ability at
disarming. Note that if an object is trapped and you open it, the
trap will be set off.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<H3>3.25. Pray</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">p - Read a prayer.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">First, a character must have learned
a prayer before he can read it. Next, when reading a prayer, he must
have the book containing the prayer in his inventory. Each prayer has
a chance of failure which starts out fairly large but decreases as a
character gains levels. If a character does not have the available
mana, he increases his chance of failure, and gambles on losing a
point of constitution. Note that since a character must read the
prayer from a book, he cannot be blind or confused and there must be
some light present.</P>
<H3>3.26. Quaff</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">q - Quaff a potion.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">To drink a potion use the Quaff
command. A potion affects the player in some manner. The effects of
the potion may be immediately noticed, or they may be subtle and
unnoticed.</P>
<H3>3.27. Read</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">r - Read a scroll.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">To read a scroll use the Read
command. A scroll spell has an area affect, except in a few cases
such as identify scrolls which act on other objects. Note that two
scrolls, the identify scroll and the recharge scroll, have titles
which can be read without setting them off, and by pressing &lt;ESCAPE&gt;
can be saved for future use.</P>
<H3>3.28. Search</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">s - Search general area one turn.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The Search command can be used to
locate hidden traps and secret doors about the player. Note that more
than a single turn of searching will be required in most cases. You
should always search a chest before trying to open it because they
are generally trapped.</P>
<H3>3.29. Take-off</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">t - Take off a piece of equipment.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Use the Take-Off command to remove an
object from use, and return it to your inventory. Occasionally you
will run into a cursed item which cannot be removed. Cursed items are
always bad, and can only be taken off after removing the curse.</P>
<H3>3.30. Use</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">u - Use a staff.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The Use command will activate a
staff. Like scrolls, most staffs have an area affect. Becasue staffs
are generally more powerful than most other items, they are also
harder to use correctly.</P>
<H3>3.31. Version</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">v - Display current version of game.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The Version command displays the
credits for the current version of Moria.</P>
<H3>3.32. Wear</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">w - Wear or wield an item being
carried.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">To wear or wield an object in your
inventory, use the Wear/Wield command. If an object is already in use
for the same function, it is automatically removed first. Note that
an objects bonuses cannot be gained until it is worn or wielded.</P>
<H3>3.33. Exchange</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">x - Exchange primary and secondary
weapons.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">A secondary weapon is any weapon
which may be needed often. Instead of searching through your
inventory, you may use the exchange command to keep the weapon ready.
For instance, if you wanted to use your bow most of the time, but
needed a sword for close combat, you could wield your sword, use the
exchange command to make it the secondary weapon, then wield your
bow. If the sword was suddenly needed, simply use the exchange
command to switch between the bow and the sword.</P>
<H3>3.34. Identify</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">/ - Identify a character shown on
screen.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Use the identify command to find out
what a character displayed on the screen stands for. For instance, by
pressing '/.', you can find out that the '.' stands for a floor spot.
When used with a creature, the identify command will tell you only
what class of creature the symbol stands for, not the specific
creature, therefore use the look command for this information.</P>
<H3>3.35. Commands</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">? - Display a list of commands.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The ? command displays a one page
quick reference help page on the screen.</P>
<H3>3.36. Repeat</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">^M - Repeat last message.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The &lt;Control&gt;-M
(Carriage-Return or Enter key) command will re-display the last
message printed on the message line at the top of your screen.</P>
<H3>3.37. Redraw</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">^R - Redraw the screen.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">To redraw the entire screen, use the
&lt;Control&gt;-R command.</P>
<H3>3.38. Quit</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">^Y - Quit the game without saving.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">To exit the game without saving your
character use the &lt;Control&gt;-Y command. Once exited in this
manner, your character is non-recoverable.</P>
<H3>3.39. Save</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">^Z - Save your character and quit the
game.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">To save your game so that it can be
restarted later, use the &lt;Control&gt;-Z command. The save file can
be moved about at will, but do not edit it. Note that a copy of a
saved character will not work after that character has died.</P>
<H3>3.40. Up</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">&lt; - Go up an up-staircase.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">If you move onto an up-staircase you
may use the '&lt;' command to go up one level. There is always one
staircase going up on every level except for the town level (this
does not mean it's easy to find). Going up a staircase will always
take you to a new dungeon area except for the town level, which
remains the same for the duration of your character.</P>
<H3>3.41. Down</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">&gt; - Go down a down-staircase.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">If you are on top of a down-staircase
you may use the '&gt;' command to go down one level. There are always
two or three staircases going down on each level, except the town
level which has only one. Going down will always take you to a new
dungeon area.</P>
<H3>3.42. Go</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">. &lt;Dir&gt; - Move in direction.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The Move command '.' will move you in
the indicated direction until one of several conditions happen. These
conditions include, a creature appearing on the screen, a creature
already on the screen moving, an object or feature such as a door, a
staircase, or a trap is adjacent to the character, character comes
into a junction of passages, or character comes to a wall with no
choice or more than one choice of continuing directions.</P>

<H2>5. Summary</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The game of MORIA is a single player
dungeon simulation. A player may choose from a number of races and
classes when creating their character, and then 'run' that character
over a period of days, weeks, even months; attempting to win the game
by defeating the Balrog which lurks in the deeper levels.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The player will begin his adventure
on the town level where he may acquire supplies, weapons, armour, and
magical devices by bartering with various shop owners. After
preparing for his adventure, the player can descend into the dungeons
of MORIA where fantastic adventures await his coming!</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Before beginning your first
adventure, you should read this document carefully. The game of MORIA
is a complicated game, and will require a dedicated player to win.</P>
<H2>6. Symbols</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Symbols on your map can be broken
down into three categories; Features of the dungeon such as walls,
floor, doors, and traps; Objects which can be picked up such as
treasure, weapons, magical devices, etc; and Monsters which may or
may not move about the dungeon, but are mostly harmful to your
character's well being.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Note that some symbols can be in more
than one category. Also note that treasure may be embedded in a wall,
and the wall must be removed before the treasure can be picked up.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">It will not be necessary to remember
all of the symbols and their meanings. A simple command; the '/';
will identify any character appearing on your map. See the section on
commands for further help.</P>

<H2>7. TOWN</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The town level is where you will begin
your adventure. The town consists of six buildings each with an
entrance, some towns 'people', and a wall which surrounds the town.
The first time you are in town it will be daytime, but you may return
to find that darkness has fallen. (Note that some spells may act
differently in the town level.)</P>
<H3>7.1. Buildings</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">You may enter any of the stores, if
they are open, and barter with the owner for items you can afford.
But be warned that the owners can easily be insulted, and may even
throw you out for a while if you insult them too often. To enter a
store, simply move onto the entrance represented by the numbers 1
through 6.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Once inside a store, his inventory
will appear on the screen along with a set of options for your
character. You may browse the store's inventory if it takes more than
one page to display, and you may sell or purchase items in his
inventory. You can execute your inventory and equipment commands to
see what you are carrying. Not shown with the options are the wear,
take-off, and exchange commands which will also work, but were
excluded to keep the options simple.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Stores do not always have everything
in stock. As the game progresses, they may get new items so check
from time to time. Also, if you sell them an item, it may get sold to
a customer while you are adventuring so don't always expect to be
able to get back anything you have sold.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Store owners will not buy harmful or
useless items. If an object is unidentified, they will pay you some
base price for it. Once they have bought it they will immediately
identify the object. If it is a good object, they will add it to
their inventory. If it was a bad bargain, they simply throw the item
away. In any case, you may receive some knowledge of the if another
is encountered.</P>
<H4>7.1.1. Alchemy shop</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Alchemy Shop deals in all manner of
potions and scrolls. The entrance to the Alchemy Shop is a 'P'.</P>
<H4>7.1.2. Armoury</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Armoury is where the town's armour
is fashioned. All sorts of protective gear may be bought and sold
here. The entrance to the Armoury is a 'A'.</P>
<H4>7.1.3. General Store</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The General Store sells foods, drinks,
some clothing, torches, lamps, oil, and spikes. All of these items,
and others, can be sold back to the General store for money. The
entrance to the General Store is a 'G'.</P>
<H4>7.1.4. Magic User's Shop</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Magic User's Shop is the most
expensive of all the stores. It deals in all sorts of rings, wands,
amulets, and staves. The entrance to the Magic Shop is a 'M'.</P>
<H4>7.1.5. Temple</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Temple deals in healing and
restoration potions, as well as bless scrolls, word-of-recall
scrolls, some approved priestly weapons, etc. The entrance to the
Temple is a 'T'.</P>
<H4>7.1.6. Weaponsmith's Shop</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Weaponsmith's Shop is where the
town's weapons are fashioned. Hand and missile weapons may be
purchased and sold here, along with arrows, bolts, and shots. The
entrance to the Weaponsmiths is a 'W'.</P>
<H4>7.1.7. Supplies</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Your character will begin his adventure
with some supplies already on him. Use the Inventory 'i' command to
check what these supplies are. It will be necessary to buy other
supplies before continuing into the dungeon, however, so be sure to
enter each of the stores.</P>
<H4>7.1.8. Townsmen</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">The town contains many different
kinds of people. There are the street urchins, young children who
will mob an adventurer for money, and seem to come out of the
woodwork when excited. Blubbering Idiots which are a constant
annoyance, but not harmful. Public drunks which wander about the town
singing, and are of no threat to anyone. Sneaky rogues, which hang
about watching for a likely victim to mug. And finally, what town
would be complete without a swarm of half drunk warriors, who take
offence or become annoyed just for the fun of it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Most of the towns people should be
avoided by the largest possible distance when you wander from store
to store. Fights will break out though, so be prepared. Since your
character grew up in this world of intrigue, no experience is awarded
for killing on the town level.</P>
